* I am currently a Research Fellow in the [Department of Statistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), working with [Elizaveta Levina](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~elevina/) and [Ji Zhu](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jizhu/).  I will be starting as an assistant professor in the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.wustl.edu/) at [Washington University in St Louis](https://wustl.edu/) starting Fall 2022.   
*  Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the [Department of Statistics and Data Sciences](https://stat.utexas.edu) at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu), where I worked with [Purnamrita Sarkar](https://psarkar.github.io/).
* I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) in Fall 2018. My advisor was [Cosma Shalizi](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/).  
* I am broadly interested in prediction and inference for data with complex dependence structures, such as networks and time series.  
* A major aim of my research has been to study the properties of resampling methods such as the bootstrap, subsampling, and the jackknife in these settings.
