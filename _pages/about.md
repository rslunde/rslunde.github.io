* I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Statistics and Data Sciences](https://stat.utexas.edu) at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu), where I work with [Purnamrita Sarkar](https://psarkar.github.io/).
* I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) in Fall 2018. My advisor was [Cosma Shalizi](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/).  
* I am broadly interested in prediction and inference for data with complex dependence structures, such as networks and time series.  
* I often adopt a nonparametric viewpoint for these problems, which has led me to study central limit theorems and the validity of resampling methods such as the bootstrap and subsampling in these settings.
