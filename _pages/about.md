* I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Statistics and Data Sciences](https://stat.utexas.edu) at the University of Texas at Austin, where I work with [Purnamrita Sarkar](https://psarkar.github.io/).
* I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by [Cosma Shalizi](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/).  
* I am broadly interested in statistical inference for dependent data
