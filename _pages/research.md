<i>Summary:</i> We establish a general theory of subsampling network data generated by the sparse
graphon model; the main requirement is weak convergence of the functional of interest. Under appropriate
sparsity conditions, we also derive a central limit theorem for eigenvalues of low-rank sparse graphons.  Our
weak convergence result immediately yields the asymptotic validity of subsampling for eigenvalues.

<i>Summary:</i> We establish conditions under which sample splitting remains asymptotically valid under
appropriate dependence conditions; neither mixing conditions nor stationarity are necessary.  In addition,
we establish a non-stationary central limit theorem by combining the Dependent Lindeberg Method of Bardet et
al. (2008) with a phenemonon involving the variance of weakly dependent sequences.  Using this central
limit theorem, we also prove the validity of the block multiplier bootstrap under $\theta$-dependence and
mean-stationarity.

<i>Summary:</i> We establish conditions under which a bootstrap estimator of the generalization error produces
valid confidence intervals for the risk of a time series model.  We show that autoregressive models satisfy
the conditions in our theorem even when the model is badly misspecified.  We also show that empirical
processes formed by splitting an absolutely regular process in half are asympotically independent.
